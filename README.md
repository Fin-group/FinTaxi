## **üåü What is FinTaxi?**  

FinTaxi is a web-based taxi booking system that allows users to book taxis easily. The website is dynamic, responsive, and integrates multiple notification services to ensure seamless communication between users and drivers.  

Whenever a user books a ride:  
‚úÖ A **WhatsApp message** is sent to confirm the booking.  
‚úÖ A **Telegram notification** is triggered.  
‚úÖ An **email confirmation** is sent to the registered user.  

This ensures that users stay informed about their bookings in real time!
